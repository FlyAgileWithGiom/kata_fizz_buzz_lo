FizzBuzz exercise
Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100, one number per line. For each printed number,
use these rules ●
following rules :
- if the number is divisible by 3 or contains 3, replace 3 by "Fizz" 
- if the number is divisible by 5 or contains 5, replace 5 by "Buzz"
- divisors have high precedence, ex: 51 -> FizzBuzz
- the content is analysed in the order they appear, ex: 
    53 -> BuzzFizz 
    13 contains 3 so we print "Fizz"
    15 is divisible by 3 and 5 and contains 5, so we print "FizzBuzzBuzz" 
    33 contains 3 two times and is divisible by 3, so we print "FizzFizzFizz"
Note: starting point:
- A hundred list generated
- First neutral case 1,2 done
